there is no entry point function

js dont have any indentation

js is block structure

js is interpreted language

it uses a concept of JIT (just in time) compilation
there is an example of tea perparation in java and js 

here data ko dekh kar js apne ap se datatype decide karenga 
here dattype decide runtime hoga thats why it is called as dynamically typed 
c, cpp , java is stsatically typed i.e datatype is decided at compile time only


in js common datatype which can hold char, float double, int i.e "number"
big int

*** premetive datatype => number, bigint , boolean, string, undefined etc
*** non premetive dataype => object(dictionary,hashmap,array), function, 

to create var 3 options => var, let, const
they are like shree, MR, Mrs

const is like constaant

mostly used var, let
they differ in block scope

var has big scope
let has small scope

mostly "let" is used

it has typeof 

jo prgm lang datype specific nahi dete unke pas typeof rehte he => js, python

js dont have sizeof

accepting input directly in js is not possible
because js accepts input from browser

we have indirect options

*** in js program exectuion starts from where aise line jo apne aap execute hogi 
lly as python

JS have 2 types of functions 
1. named function (normal)
2. unnamed function(arrow function or anonymous function)

log is like a small diary of a browser

arrow function is also called as fat arrow

always refer normal function
if you need a function for short span of time like use and throw

*** in fat arrow function the logic should be of 1 line it is a limitation

every fat arrow can covert int o normal but vice versa is not true

*** fat arrow is like inline function like urban clab
*** means in the caller line only the function logic is replaced lly as inline, macro

*** in js we can pass function as a parameter

in js we can return function as a parameter

*** function is treated as object in js

** in js is internally an array of caharacters without \0

typescript code gets transpile means convert one high lang to another highlevel language
Angular => typescript
React => Javascript
